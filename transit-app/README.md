## Project Summary
This project will design and implement a full-stack web application that simulates a regional bus transit scheduling system, inspired by Kings Transit (https://www.kbus.ca/). Our goal is to apply course concepts by building a complete system with a frontend interface, a backend API, and a database for storing and managing transit data.

A user should be able to browse available bus routes, stops, and schedules, search or filter by route or stop, and view route details. Admin users (or staff) will be able to create, update, or delete routes and schedules.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery/AJAX)
- **Backend**: PHP or Python
- **Database**: MySQL
